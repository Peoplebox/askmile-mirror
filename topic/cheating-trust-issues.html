<div class='answer-content-text'>Cheating is a painful, deeply unsettling experience, but is also a subjective one. Some relationships come out stronger after a couple has properly dealt with the incident, why it happened and with the partner who wavered, while other relationships don&#39;t stop going down the downward spiral till the relationship is finished.

<div class='answer-content-text'>One enters into marriage with dreams of hoping to start a new journey with their partner that is filled with love and happiness. For a happy and successful marriage, both partners need to be equally invested to work towards it. With the foundation of the marriage itself, trust and commitment, not in place, this is certainly not why someone enters into a marriage. I can imagine your pain and agony.

Before moving on any further, ask yourself if you are willing at all to give a chance to this marriage or not. Also try to figure out if your husband is willing to do the same. If either of you...</div>

It seems that you are facing difficulty in your marriage. Getting to know of your husband&#39;s infidelity has caused you a lot of pain so much so that you feel depressed to an extent where the thought of ending your life has also crossed your mind. Although your husband feels guilt and remorse but you are finding it difficult to forget it and the thought has become unbearable for you and you wish to end the marriage.

<div class='answer-content-text'>Dear Writer, I appreciate your having written in. I understand that you are having a hard time trusting your husband and your reasons perfectly justify your fears. Trust is the foundation of any relation and once broken can be very hard to rebuild. 
How was your relationship prior to your finding out about his indiscretions?
Now having said that, the question remains what do you want to do? You had to go through a painful experience and whether you healed from it or not is for you to answer. Either way you fear getting hurt again by your husband and have pulled back to protect yourself....</div>

As for the emotional suffering, I see that it has not only hurt and angered you, but has also made you doubt yourself.

You also mention that yours is a love marriage and you&#39;ll are together for last 10 years.

What you are experiencing is a regular form of possessiveness when you are in a relationship, but there is a thin line of difference between it looking cute and bad. Now that you know that he loves you, then start trusting and come out of the suspicion that you have for your relationship.

How to do it is very simple, have faith on yourself and know that you are everything you would need, and automatically you will feel secure about people around you, in that way you won&#39;t be in any doubt on anyone near by you.

Thanks.</div>

At the same time, you seem to be smart and aware of your situation. I understand you want to give your husband the benefit of doubt. But first, ponder over a few points: If you were in this girl&#39;s place, would you still be texting those words to a man who had indeed ended his relationship with you a year back? If this relationship ended and your husband has nothing to hide, why is he keeping his phone locked? Does he share his mobile password with you freely or does he flinch if you check his...</div>

<div class='answer-content-text'>Greetings,

It takes lot of courage to actually write what you are feeling through and I can see that you are filled with guilt of what happened, and like you said it happened in the spur of moments and it is not necessary to be so hard on yourself. One of the many things that we human beings often forget is to be kind to self and it is okay that you have committed the mistake, but the important thing is that you have the realization of what you did and now that you have to work to make it better.

About getting back with your boy friend, that is completely your choice to go ahead with that...</div>

<div class='answer-content-text'>Hi,

Thank you for writing to us finally. You have indeed taken this for a very long time and have a very big heart to have forgiven your wife even after learning regarding her physical relationship. And now you are again standing on the same junction as you were five years ago.

I am sure you must be very sure of this having happened again and you are not just feeling so traumatised from some false information. 

It must be very difficult to keep forgiving her and any person would consider divorce as an option to save his self respect. 

However I would ask you to give this another thought...</div>

<div class='answer-content-text'>Hello,

It is really commendable that you have carried in this relationship for so many years. Also good that you have finally decided to take help. 

It is not surprising that you have all the physical ailments which are due to the constant stress and pressure you have been living in. 

The first thing to do is take care of your health. Focus in yourself and stop thinking about what is happening with your husband and his morals. Four years of no work is what have caused the other issues of depression and migraine. So being in with the first goal that is take care of your health. 

There...</div>
