For that your friend needs to realise that actions have consequences and so far he hasn&#39;t had to deal with the consequences.

I know you love him so much, and you can&#39;t give up on him. And I know it&#39;s difficult to trust a person again, once you loose the trust on him. What do you think? what type of a  person he is? Explore more on it, get to know more about him.The more you explore the better you get to know!

She built up the courage and first thing that she did was to go to her parents and spoke with her parents regarding this faulty relationship, later she went and told him that she wouldn&#39;t want to continue the relationship. I can see that you clearly still care for him, hence you wrote that you don&#39;t want him to die, let me tell you that if you are in this relationship it is clearly stressing you out and you need to get out of that relationship. Also I assure you that, such an abusive person won&#39;t end up his life...</div>

I can actually feel the torment you are going through. You took a right step by writing to find some solace and answers to your woes. 

You have mentioned that you are staying away from him because of the nature of his work. You have also mentioned that you are working. I am a little confused then how you have to beg for allowance and how he shows his displeasure about you visiting and taking care of your parents. 

However from what I have understood, you want more attention, loving words and care from him. You want the excitement you had in the earlier years of your love and...</div>
