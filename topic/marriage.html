One enters into marriage with dreams of hoping to start a new journey with their partner that is filled with love and happiness.

<div class='answer-content-text'>Dear Ravi, thank you for writing to us. It shows 
courage on your part for having reached out to us. I understand you feel distressed and insecure about your situation. However to understand and help you accordingly could you tell me more about yourself and your wife as individuals and about your relationship as well? How are things between the two of you? 
Is there a reason for your wife&#39;s dislike towards your family? Can you also tell me how they interact with each other? 
Please do message back to continue our discussion. We can figure it out together. Regards.</div>

Thank you for writing in. It does take tremendous courage to be open about your crisis. I am a doctor who has been practising therapy for several years. 

Your sense of &quot;jealousy&quot; is understandable. To establish if it stems from some real facts (which is your view point) or you are making deductions (which is likely your husband&#39;s viewpoint), we need to be a bit more objective.

I&#39;d like to appreciate you for trying to face your problem and trying to help yourself. It takes a lot of courage to do that.

I know you&#39;re going through a difficult time right now. 
You&#39;re torn apart what what you want and what you feel is right.

From what you&#39;ve told me, I understand that you know what it feels like to be cheated on and the emotional damage it can cause to the other person.

So you know to some extent that even harmless texting can hurt the other person involved.

Its not easy to admit that and by doing so you have already moved one step towards your happiness.

From what you&#39;ve said, it seems like you haven&#39;t completely dealt with the feelings of your breakup with your ex.

You mentioned you were happy with him and that you&#39;re attracted to this man who reminds you of him.

The first thing to do is to remind yourself of the reason why you broke up.
Your ex cheated on you.

It is totally normal to have feelings for a person, as long as the person knows that you are interested and also my strong suggestion to you is that do not follow the so called &quot;+ve signals&quot;, and ask her verbally and get her opinion on you.

After that you can escalate the topic and you can take the families for a lunch or something and ask them openly. There is saying, if you want something you got to ask for it, or else you won&#39;t get it.

Thank you.</div>

<div class='answer-content-text'>hi,

From what i understand you expect him to support you in certain way in which he is not responding.

Usually our expectations of expression of affection , support and love arise from the way we give, however when partner expresses in different ways, we are unable to recognise that and keep feeling ignored, so learn the ways in which he expresses support.

if you could also tell me more about the same with examples of times when he chooses to stay away from you either asking on personal message or question back, we can work on it in depth

Hope this helps :)</div>

<div class='answer-content-text'>Hi,
At the start of the marriage, it may take time for partners to understand each other and become intimate. From what you have said about your relationship, you both seem to like and understand each other. Communication is key. Talk to each other about the issue, and if it still seems like you both have a problem, it would be best to consult a sexologist or have a proper thorough checkup with a psychologist as well to see where the issue lies. Wishing you both all the best.</div>

Its great to notice that you are already aware of different personalities both of you have and are looking for solution, where as there is nothing wrong in having upfront nature or being sensitive to words and tone, solution would be found in learning new communication skills and practicing those from both ends , where you can  learn to express your strong views in assertive ways then that from making him feel that you are aggressive, that will help him feel safe and lower down his irritation and anger outbursts as well. 

Once he feels safe you can always talk to him about how both of...</div>

You must be a really brave lady to have endured this pain for the past 10 years and coming out now and sharing this, could not have been easy. being in an abusive relationship is not healthy and I am sure you must have seen it take a toll on your health.
